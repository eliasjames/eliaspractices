          <h1>Freedom of Feeling</h1>
          <p>
You can train yourself to choose your feelings in any situation.

A lot of people are going to react negatively to that statement. "No, I can't", they scream. "DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!"

I'm not saying it's easy. In fact, I'm still learning how to do it. I believe it's possible, but I also understand the arguments against it.

The actions of other people. An old buddy recently spilled their guts on Facebook, found out their partner had been cheating on them for a long time.

There's facts and feelings. I didn't say you could choose the facts, only the feelings. But you can choose between them.

An affair, by definition, involves keeping secrets. Secrets cause a betrayal of trust. Those are facts. Your relationship with this person has changed.

There are things you have to do to deal with those facts. Maybe you have to change the locks, either to the doors or to your heart. But you can do what you need to do, and feel different ways about it.

I used to be outraged at injustice in the world. I marched in demonstrations, wrote letters to my Congresspeople, voted in every election. But all the negativity wore me out. So I chose to give it up. I still keep up the same activity - marching, letters, voting - I'm just not angry about it anymore. It's a chore, homework, like brushing your teeth or clipping your nails.

Sometimes getting angry is a very efficient tactic to get through an experience you're resisting. Having to break up a relationship you didn't want to end ranks as one of the most difficult things a person can experience, regardless of the reason. If you need to reach for a tool to help you through those high mountains, I pass no judgement.

The problem is when you reach for the tool walking down the sidewalk of everyday experience. If you wear a weight belt while you lift, you risk developing a weakness when it's off. And when you reach for anger to get through daily tasks, you dilute its potency for when it's really needed.

My buddy kept coming back to betrayal. They had expected their partner to be with them forever. But you can't possibly ask that of someone else, because there's no guarantee of tomorrow.

"My children are different. If something threatens the safety of my children, I can't be responsible for my feelings. I'll do whatever I have to do for them.".

Children are in a different category. They make it much, much harder, but it's a difference in scale and not in kind. Again, doing and feeling don't have to be the same thing. If a person threatens your family, you do what it takes: change the locks, restraining order, self defense training.

Instead of blind anger, it's better to choose a steely, hard-eyed resolution.
